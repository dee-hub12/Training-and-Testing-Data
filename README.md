# Training-and-Testing-Data
This project will help us understand training and testing error, implementing sample-splitting  and trying statistical prediction methods.

We will implement sample-splitting techniques to divide the dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the statistical prediction models, while the testing set will be used to assess the performance of these models. We will evaluate the training error, which represents how well the model fits the training data. Subsequently, we will assess the testing error, which indicates the model's performance on unseen data, allowing us to estimate its predictive ability.We will compare and contrast the performance of the different statistical prediction methods based on their training and testing error. This analysis will help us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method in terms of predictive accuracy and generalizability.
